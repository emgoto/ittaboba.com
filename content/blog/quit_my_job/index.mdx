I did it! I quit my job. It's definitely not the safest decision I could make in such uncertain times. Considering that I have no clients, no contracts, no startup ideas with early traction, no audience, and no proven experience with any of them, it might not even seem the smartest.

Many people are losing their jobs and I have left mine on purpose without guarantees. Frankly, sometimes I feel guilty about it. It was far from an easy choice. I thought about it carefully for months. Then I imagined myself in 20 years and concluded that **the biggest risk is living with regrets**. 

In this article, I go through the questions that I have obsessively asked myself hundreds of times before making the choice. A year ago my answers would have been very different. I am quite sure they will be in a year too. Roads and plans can change moving towards my final destination: **make a living doing what I love**. I will know that I have arrived once I no longer feel that peak of excitement at the beginning of the weekends and the holidays alternating with a peak of frustration at the end.

## Why now?
In late 2020, I finished my Master's in machine learning & AI. I pursued it while working as a full-stack developer for a mid-sized company based in Milan. Both experiences have made me grow as a person and as a professional. Among the many commitments, I also found the time to travel and make new friends by visiting new cities and participating in conferences and hackathons.

At some point, the world has been turned upside down. I found myself working and studying alone in my bedroom overnight. As the weeks went by, I have begun to realize that those **new habits imposed by the pandemic are laying the foundations for this decade**. The way people work and learn is slightly changing day by day.

A year later, we are in the midst of health, economic, psychological, and social crises. All at the same time. We will recover and start traveling and meeting again. But such **sudden and radical changes in people's lifestyles will make things unpredictably different**. We can escape fear or seize the opportunities that come with it. I chose the latter.

## What is the opportunity?
Every crisis causes a redistribution of value. The biggest opportunity I see is the **decentralization of expertise**. The knowledge economy is going to be very different in 10 years because of it. 

Workplaces and the workforce have begun to decentralize. As a student or worker, it means that it is no longer strictly necessary to be in certain places to get a meaningful advantage of any kind. As a university or company, it means that you have easy access to a global pool of talents. Some cities and regions will continue to be more representative of certain fields (e.g. Milan for design and fashion, Emilia-Romagna for motorsport, California for information technology). I lived in Milan for almost 6 years. I've been multiple times to the other two, met people, visited their universities and companies. Nothing will ever replace the value of experiencing and breathing the collective intelligence of a place in person. However, vibrant new online communities are springing up every day on every topic. I am part of some of them and they work very well.

Experts are online now. They were previously too. But now, whether you are a company, a self-employed, a student, or just a curious person, **the world is coming to you like never before**. The pandemic has normalized and speeded up remote communications. Many people and organizations will probably stay concentrated in specific areas, but accessible from everywhere if you like. Otherwise, they will no longer be competitive.

## What are the risks involved?
There are internal and external risks. 

**Internal risks are based on personal assumptions**. They are subjective, therefore potentially misleading. *Does the opportunity I see really exist? How to make the most of it? How sustainable is it in the long term?* It is my job to de-risk these kinds of hypotheses with regular testing and retrospectives. 

**External risks are based on facts**. In my case, the pandemic forced me to return to my home. Due to this and very limited travel, my expenses are much lower than before. I've just finished my formal studies. I gained some work experience in the office and remotely and saw the pros and cons of both. I am still missing some key mindsets and skills to achieve my goal of making a living doing what I love.

Balancing all these elements, I thought it was the right time to invest some time and savings into filling my knowledge gaps while working on projects that make me happy and meeting like-minded people online.

## What are my key milestones?
I decided to **build a portfolio of small bets** as recommended by [Daniel Vassallo](https://twitter.com/dvassallo). Hopefully, some of them will succeed, others will fail. Here's what I decided to focus my energies on for the next few months:

### Gems
My first bet is a startup idea to pursue my vision of [extending human cognition with AI](https://gemsnotes.app/blog/augmented-cognition). My goal is to reach Problem/Solution Fit by the end of June.

### 90-day startup
This is an [online course](https://leanstack.com/training/90-day-startup) led by Ash Maurya, the inventor of the Lean Canvas. I am part of a team and in 3 months we will learn how to take our idea from concept to Problem/Solution Fit. 

I've spent almost a decade learning how to build solutions. Unfortunately, that's not enough to make products that people buy and use. I believe that learning how to find problems worth solving (in any domain) quickly and safely is what separates me from my dreams. That's the promise of the course and I see it as a lifetime investment.

I will work with my team and transfer in real time the same concepts on Gems. It may sound overwhelming. My bet here is to work smarter on two ideas rather than harder on just one. 

### Stock market investments
My third and last bet is something I have never done before. I don't know anything about stock market investments but I want to test if it is a viable way to mitigate the lack of monthly income a little bit. I cannot expect big results, I am more curious to learn how it works and do some little experiments for now.

## Can I pull this off?
It's quite clear that I am missing some pieces to complete the puzzle. However, **if I had waited to feel ready, I probably would never have started**. Plus, I'm much more comfortable learning by doing. I am building systems, mental models, and relationships to make as few mistakes as possible:
- I constantly engage in online communities to stay accountable and keep my thinking always open to fresh ideas from diverse people.
- I designed a [spreadsheet](/article/5feb11fd7d0c7c0ba5620f4b) for continuous planning and retrospection that I update daily. It helps me set my goals and priorities, make reasonable estimates of activities' complexity to achieve them, monitor progress, and evaluate results.
- I decided to learn and build in public to share wins and failures with people on the same path.
